A stepwise approach and patience can go a long way  in the eventual result. The treatment options for pigmentation include depigmenting creams, chemical peeling and lasers. The treatment of acne scars depends upon the nature of the scar. The scars can be pitted dot like scars or broader in nature (which can be superficial or deep). The very superficial scars respond to medium depth chemical peeling. Most other scars need intervention such as microneedling or resurfacing lasers."

Allergen can be something in the air , the food we eat, something from our work place (occupational), personal care products, plants we grow, our pets, mosquitoes, medicines and so on, beyond that can be listed here. The presentation of allergy can be tiny bumps, shaped like a coin which disappear after a while , or rashes at a specific site or the entire body with or without itching. Some resolve once the allergen is avoided. Some persist. "

        ans: "Many times the allergen is very difficult to identify. Few are allergic to one allergen and others are allergic to more than just one. The allergen can be identified in some with the help of tests like blood investigations, skin patch tests or prick tests. Once identified there is a chance of staying away from the allergen if it's feasible. It is best to acquire a thorough knowledge of what the condition is and what needs to be done."

The condition though trivial is very distressing to experience. The condition occurs all of a sudden and  lasts for a few days or weeks  to even months in others called  Acute and chronic urticaria respectively. It may or may not be associated with other allergic tendencies like asthma, wheezing, eczema, sinusitis etc.. The itching in some can be associated with breathing difficulty , swelling of lips in which case it becomes an emergency."

On many occasions a person  is allergic to more than one agent and avoiding  it may not be practical. Identification of the allergen can be done by patch testing  for a few patients and can be of immense help in the treatment process."
      },
      {
        quest: "Treatment",
        ans: "Trying to find the trigger by patch testing and avoiding it. Staying away from common known triggers such as dairy products,  packed/canned foods, foods with preservatives and additives, coloured foods, chocolates, alcohol, known allergic foods, certain nuts and potatoes. Anti allergic drugs are the mainstay of treatment. This class of drugs come with the advantage of having least adverse effects even on long-term consumption. Other advanced immunomodulatory drugs are also available for resistant cases of urticaria which offer long term remission."

The procedure is very comfortable for the patient with excellent results. The laser targets the melanin pigment of hair and so naturally only the pigmented hair (black hair) can be treated. Grey hairs do not respond to this treatment. Fair skin with dark thick hair is an excellent combination for the laser treatment. But as mentioned earlier this technology works best for Indian skin types. For best results 4-6 sittings are essential with one to two months intervals which will vary with the individual’s requirements. There will be 20-30% hair reduction with each treatment. So by the end of 5-6 sitting there will be 80-90% hair reduction. And the hair reduction is permanent.If you need more information regarding laser hair removal, Contact us on Skinreflect@gmail.com"

Hypertrichosis- the word hyper- ’increase’ and tricho meaning ‘hair’  is defined as increase in body hair beyond the normal variation for a patient’s reference group. Most often it runs in the family and is just a cosmetic problem. The body hair becomes a problem when the thin vellus hair is replaced by thick terminal hairs such those present in the scalp or eyebrows. The increase in body hair can be localised to a region or present throughout the body. It can be present since birth or in few, it might represent an underlying systemic health problem especially when it occurs late in life."

        ans: "Females showing facial hair growth in a male pattern is called hirsutism.This is quite different from hypertrichosis. The excess hair grown is usually dark and thick in nature called the terminal hair and in male pattern distribution such as over the beard, upper lip ,chest or the abdomen. Most commonly it occurs after puberty. The causes can be constitutional (parents having similar growth), hormonal with or without underlying PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) and menstrual cycle disturbances. It could be associated with weight gain, acne, hair loss or thinning of hair. Therefore the underlying cause has to be evaluated with the help of thorough physical examination, biochemical tests and imaging studies. It can be effectively treated with the help of lasers which can be a great stress relief to the patient."
